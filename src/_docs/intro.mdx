# Mocked Design System

This is a mocked design system package used for testing multiple instances of Storybook in a monorepo setup. It provides basic UI components and styles to simulate a real design system without the complexity of a full implementation.

## Developing

Watch and rebuild code with `tsup` and runs Storybook to preview your UI during development.

```console
pnpm run storybook
```

## Building

Build package with `tsup` for production.

```console
pnpm run build
```
